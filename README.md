# Media Recommenders Suite 
(MRS) for short is a set of 4 recommendation engines that are deployed to the cloud and serve recommendations on 4 types of media:
- movies
- music
- audiobooks
- podcasts
The app uses Python algorithms that take as inputs user's preferences for media they liked e.g. Titanic, Jumanji and outputs a list of other movies they may like. It performs this for all 4 types of media not just movies. The compuation part takes place in AWS Lambda functions. These are triggered by events generated by file uploads. Our engines work on 4 large NoSQL databases implemented in DynamoDB. These databases persist large quanities of movie titles, podcasts etc.

The main purpose of the project is learning AWS system design. With significant amount of work done in Python too.
